CRIME_DESCRIPTION = """The video appears to be recorded from a stationary surveillance camera overlooking a relatively secluded urban or semi-urban alleyway. It is approximately one minute long and captured at night or in low-light conditions, which adds a gritty, realistic tone to the footage. Initially, the scene is calm, with no visible movement. A streetlamp provides limited illumination, casting elongated shadows across the pavement.

Roughly ten seconds into the clip, a lone individual enters the frame from the left side, walking at a brisk pace. The person is dressed in dark, loose-fitting clothing and appears to be wearing a hood, which obscures part of their face. Their demeanor is tense and watchful, with repeated glances over the shoulder, suggesting a sense of urgency or anxiety.

Midway through the video, the figure stops beside a parked vehicle and begins interacting with the driver's side door. The movements are precise and hurriedâ€”suggesting either forced entry or a quick unlocking process. This action takes place in partial shadow, adding to the clandestine nature of the act. Moments later, the car's interior lights briefly flash on, indicating the door may have been opened.

As the video nears its end, the individual slips into the vehicle and sits still for a moment before the headlights flicker. The person then drives away, exiting the frame from the right side. The act is swift and deliberate, implying familiarity with the process and suggesting it may be a car theft or unauthorized use.

Overall, the video portrays a likely criminal act captured in real-time. The figure's guarded movements, time of activity, and methodical actions all contribute to the impression of illicit behavior, potentially valuable for investigative purposes."""
