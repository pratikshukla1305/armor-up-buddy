                Abuse can take many forms including physical, verbal, emotional, or psychological. The behavior displayed 
                indicates a pattern of harmful or controlling actions that may cause distress or harm to the victim. 
                Such incidents require immediate attention from authorities to protect the victim from further harm.""",
                
    "Arrest": """The footage shows what appears to be an arrest situation, where law enforcement officers are 
                detaining an individual. Standard arrest procedures typically involve restraining the subject, 
                often with handcuffs, after informing them of their rights. The video shows characteristics consistent 
                with official police procedures during a lawful apprehension. This requires proper documentation and

                Arson is characterized by intentional ignition of structures, vehicles, or other property, often 
                leaving distinctive burn patterns and evidence of accelerants. This serious offense endangers lives 
                and property, requiring specialized investigation techniques by fire investigators and law enforcement.""",

                engaged in physical violence against another person. Assault is characterized by intentional physical 
                contact or threatening behavior that puts the victim in fear of immediate harm. The severity can range 
                from minor altercations to serious attacks potentially causing significant injury."""
